# HelicopterCrashSites

DayZ inspired

## Overview

BepInEx plugin that will add random helicopter crash sites into SPT-AKI. The initial chance is 10%, but it can be adjusted in the configuration manager (`F12` key) or alternatively, if you've launched up the game at least once with this mod, you can find the `com.SamSWAT.HeliCrash.cfg` file in your `BepInEx/config/` folder and change value there.

If you were lucky, after loading into the raid you may find downed UH-60 Blackhawk by thick column of smoke, its position is random and choosed from `HeliCrashLocations.json` file, here you can add your own locations or delete them. There should be a container with loot at the rear of the helicopter, currently, because of some limitations, it's just a copy of what was generated for the airdrop so technically there's no way to alter what will be in the container without affecting airdrops.
